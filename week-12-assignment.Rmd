### Starting Up

In this assignment, I intend to try out `RNeo4j`, a R driver package for Neo4j. The CRAN documentation can be found here: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNeo4j/RNeo4j.pdf

I will use `RNeo4j` to migrate the small flight and airport data, provided by the class Neo4j Query Lab, to a Neo4j database. 

To reproduce the codes and results of this assignment, the reader must first have a Neo4j database set up and running in the back.

Below code will connect to the Neo4j database. Reader should adjust the username/password.

```{r warning=F, message=F}
library(RNeo4j)
library(knitr)
graph <- startGraph("http://localhost:7474/db/data/", username = "neo4j", password = "12345")
```  

Below is an optional step to clear any existing nodes and relations in the database.

```{r}
clear(graph, input = F)
```

Let's load the data and examine them.

```{r}
airports <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyllis/Data607/master/neo4j-airport-csv-raw.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
flights <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyllis/Data607/master/neo4j-flight-lab-data.csv", stringsAsFactors=F)
kable(airports)
kable(flights)
```

### Data Migration

First, I will write the query to create airport nodes.

```{r}
query <- "
MERGE (:Airport {label:{label_name}, city:{city_name}, state:{state_name}})
"
```

To migrate the airport data, I will use a for-loop to go thru each row, retrieve the airport data, and use the `query` above to create cypher query. The `appendCypher` function will collect the cypher query created in each loop into a transaction object.

```{r}
# Create a transaction object
t <- newTransaction(graph)

# Append the cypher queries to the transaction object
for (i in 1:nrow(airports)){
  appendCypher(t,
               query,
               label_name = airports[i,]$label,
               city_name = airports[i,]$city,
               state_name = airports[i,]$state)
}

# Execute the transaction
commit(t)
```

The `commit` function will execute the migration.

Similarly, I will now add the flights nodes. I will also add the relations between flights and airports.

```{r}
query <- "
MERGE (f:Flight {flight:{flnm}, airline:{alnm}, capacity:{cpct}})
WITH f
MATCH (a:Airport {label:{depart}}), (c:Airport {label:{arrive}}) 
CREATE (a) -[:DEPART {takeoff:{tkof}}]-> (f) -[:ARRIVE {landing:{ldng}}]-> (c)
"

t <- newTransaction(graph)

for (i in 1:nrow(flights)){
  appendCypher(t,
               query,
               flnm = flights[i,]$flight,
               alnm = flights[i,]$airline,
               cpct = flights[i,]$capacity,
               tkof = flights[i,]$takeoff,
               ldng = flights[i,]$landing,
               depart = flights[i,]$depart ,
               arrive = flights[i,]$arrive)
}

commit(t)
```

### Checking Results

We can now check the migration result in the browser.

```{r}
browse(graph, viewer = T)
```

Setting `viewer = F` will open the graph in the default browser; otherwise, it will be opened in R's viewer pane.

Calling MATCH (n) RETURN (n) will return the following visual representation of the graph:

To further verify the migration, we can write queries and use `cypher` function to retrieve the data from the Neo4j database and turn into a data.frame object in R.

Below query will match and return any nodes with Airport tag.

```{r}
query <- "
MATCH (a:Airport)
RETURN a.label, a.city, a.state
"
kable(cypher(graph, query))
```

Below query will match and return the flight data, by looking at the relations between airports and flights.

```{r}
query <- "
MATCH (a:Airport) -[b:DEPART]-> (c:Flight) -[d:ARRIVE]-> (e:Airport)
RETURN c.flight, c.airline, a.label AS depart, e.label AS arrive, c.capacity, b.takeoff, d.landing
ORDER BY c.flight
"
kable(cypher(graph, query))
```

As you can see, the two tables are identical to the csv files we imported earlier. The migration is successful.
