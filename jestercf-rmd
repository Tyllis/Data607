The website of interest here is Jester, a website that recommend jokes to you based on the ratings you've given to the jokes you've read.

http://eigentaste.berkeley.edu/index.html.

It is a research website created by UC Berkeley to study social information filtering.


### Scenario Design Analysis

**1. Who are your target users?**

People who likes to read jokes. These are the people who enjoys textual/verbal humor. 

**2. What are their key goals?**

Their key goal is to relax and have a good laugh, while avoiding wasting precious time on a bad joke, or a joke they found offensive.

**3. How can you help them accomplish those goals?**

We can help them by recommending jokes that are likely to be funny to them.


### Reverse Engineering

The interface of the website is fairly simple. Once you click "Begin", you will get a random joke from the website. Below the joke is a meter where you can rate the joke "Less Funny" or "More Funny". You then click "Next", and get another joke, and so on.

The more jokes you read and rate, the more likely that the next joke you read will suit your taste and make you laugh. 

When you click on the question mark "?", the website takes you to their research website, where you can find the data sets they collected from this website. 

Based on these information, I am guessing that they are using a form of collaborative filtering recommender system.

From one of the data sets, I attempted to create a collaborative filtering system. This was my best attempt to mimic their system. 

See this Rpub link I created for more detail: http://rpubs.com/azureblue83/327856


### Recommendations

The rating system on Jester is kind of one dimensional. The users are asked only to rate the jokes on a "funny meter".

In essence, it uses the response variable (i.e. the "funny meter") to perform collaborative filtering. 

But jokes have more dimensions to explore. "General Theory of Verbal Humor" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke#Classification_systems layed out six levels of jokes in general. Quoting from expedia.com:

1. Script Opposition (SO) This includes, among others, themes such as real (unreal), actual (non-actual), normal (abnormal), possible (impossible).
2. Logical Mechanism (LM) refers to the mechanism which connects the different scripts in the joke. These can range from a simple verbal technique like a pun to more complex LMs such as faulty logic or false analogies.
3. Situation (SI) can include objects, activities, instruments, props needed to tell the story.
4. Target (TA) identifies the actor(s) who become the "butt" of the joke. This labelling serves to develop and solidify stereotypes of ethnic groups, professions, etc.
5. Narrative strategy (NS) addresses the narrative format of the joke, as either a simple narrative, a dialogue, or a riddle. It attempts to classify the different genres and subgenres of verbal humour. In a subsequent study Attardo expands the NS to include oral and printed humorous narratives of any length, not just jokes.
6. Language (LA) "…contains all the information necessary for the verbalization of a text. It is responsible for the exact wording …and for the placement of the functional elements."

This classification system attempts to explain why a joke is funny. It can represent the explanatory variables. If the Jester system incorporates these explanatory dimensions into the system, it may help to improve the convergent rate.
